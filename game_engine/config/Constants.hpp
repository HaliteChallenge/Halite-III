    The two FACTOR_EXP constants do related things but they are not the same.
    FACTOR_EXP_1 exponentiates the distribution used to seed the randomness.
    FACTOR_EXP_2 exponentiates the final distribution just prior to normalization.
    Broadly, both will give spikier maps. However (and perhaps counterintuitively), using
    FACTOR_EXP_1 will give maps that have more individual, small-scale spikes. Conversely,
    FACTOR_EXP_2 gives maps that moreso utilize the global structure, and have less noise.
    FACTOR_EXP_2 is also more sensitive than FACTOR_EXP_1.
