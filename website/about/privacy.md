## YOUR EUROPEAN UNION PRIVACY RIGHTS.

Individuals who are located in or residents of the European Union have certain data subject rights that may be subject to limitations and/or restrictions.

**You have the right to access, rectify and, subject to our other legal obligations and business considerations, erase your personal information.** You also have the right to ask us to restrict the purpose or to object to the processing of your personal information as well as a right to data portability.

**Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried out for our legitimate interest or for direct marketing.**

## YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.

Individuals who are residents of California have certain consumer rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), effective January 1, 2020, but which may be subject to certain limitations and/or restrictions. Specifically, under the CCPA you may have the right to:

* Request that we disclose information about the personal information collected, used, disclosed or sold;
* Request that we delete personal information collected or maintained by us;
* Opt out of the sale of your personal information; and
* Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights.

Please note that we do not, and will not, sell your personal information.

_How do I Authorize an Agent?_

A consumer may use an authorized agent to submit a request on the consumer’s behalf. When using an authorized agent, we require that you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and verify their own identity and agent status with us. If you would like to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please email us at [CCPA@twosigma.com](mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com).

_Can I Receive this Privacy Policy in Alternative Formats?_

Yes. If you require this notice in an alternative accessible format, please email us at [CCPA@twosigma.com](mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com).

_What is your process for verifying consumer requests?_

We have instituted a process for verifying that the person making a request to know or a request for deletion is the consumer about whom we have collected information. Whenever feasible, we will match at least two data points in the identifying information provided by the consumer to the Personal Information already maintained by us, but it may require more data points depending on the information requested. We will avoid collecting highly sensitive pieces of personal information, unless necessary.

In verifying your identity, we will consider the following factors:

* The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected and maintained about the consumer.  Sensitive or valuable personal information shall warrant a more stringent verification process.  The types of personal information identified in Civil Code section 1798.81.5(d) shall be considered presumptively sensitive;
* The risk of harm to the consumer posed by any unauthorized access or deletion. A greater risk of harm to the consumer by unauthorized access or deletion shall warrant a more stringent verification process;
* The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the personal information.  The higher the likelihood, the more stringent the verification process will be;
* Whether the personal information to be provided by the consumer to verify their identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests or being spoofed or fabricated;
* The manner in which the business interacts with the consumer; and
* Available technology for verification.

If we cannot verify your identity in accordance with California law, we may deny your request in whole or in part.

For online requests to delete, we will use a two-step process where the consumer must first, clearly submit the request to delete and then second, separately confirm that they want their personal information deleted.

For requests to know and requests to delete, we will confirm receipt of the request within ten (10) days and provide information about how the business will process the request, and we will respond within 45 days with an option to extend an additional 45 days provided we give you notice.

_How do I Submit a Consumer Request?_

If you wish to exercise any of your rights under this section, you may submit your request through any of these methods: (i) email us at [CCPA@twosigma.com](mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com); (ii) call us at the toll-free telephone number [1-844-820-6577](tel:+1-844-820-6577); or (iii) submit a webform request here.

**Shine the Light Inquiry**

If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email, or write to us at the address listed below. Indicate in your letter that you are a California resident making a “Shine the Light” inquiry.

## WE USE STANDARD SECURITY MEASURES.

We take reasonable steps, consistent with industry standards, including technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, the Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our Site or software will be completely safe.  We encourage you to use caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet. We keep personal information for as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy, for internal compliance or record-keeping purposes, or as otherwise required by law. Because information about, for example, the results of the competition, may be useful to you and to others for purposes of credentialing, we plan to keep that personal information available for approximately five years. If you want to be able to reference it beyond that period, you should arrange to copy and store it yourself.

## WE MAY TRANSFER AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES.

By participating in the Halite competition using the Site, you understand that your personal information will be processed in the U.S. where we operate the Site. Personal information we maintain may be transferred to and stored both within and outside of the United States. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your personal information to the United States. This Site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in your country. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## WE MAY LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES OR HAVE THIRD PARTY SERVICES ON OUR SITE WE DON’T CONTROL.

If you click on a link to a third party website, you will be taken to website(s) that we do not control.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of such third party website(s).  Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully before you submit any personal information to these third party website(s).  We are not responsible for actions, omissions or practices of third party website(s).
