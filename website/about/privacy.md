## WE USE STANDARD SECURITY MEASURES.

We take reasonable steps, consistent with industry standards, including technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, the Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our Site or software will be completely safe.  We encourage you to use caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet. We keep personal information for as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy, for internal compliance or record-keeping purposes, or as otherwise required by law. Because information about, for example, the results of the competition, may be useful to you and to others for purposes of credentialing, we plan to keep that personal information available for approximately five years. If you want to be able to reference it beyond that period, you should arrange to copy and store it yourself.
