Don't expect very much abstraction, and expect to get your hands
quite dirty, this is C after all. Here is some documentation to
give you a basic run down of wtf is happening:

	map:				An array of all map tiles'

	dropoffs:			An array of all dropoffs (x/y coordinates)
	mhh:				Map half height. Useful for determining distance
	mhw:				Map half width. Useful for determining distance

	map_size:			[0] is width, [1] is height
	number_of_players:	The... number of players?

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

This bot has only been tested on Linux, with the GNU C library
(glibc), and the GCC compiler. To build, simply open your terminal,
cd into this directory, and type "make". You can modify the makefile
however you like. Then you upload your C bot, the halite server will
compile your bot using the makefile.




NOTES:

Your bot name must end with a \n new line character, or else your bot
will fail to initialize.
