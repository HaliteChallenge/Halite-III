Welcome to the C starter kit.

Don't expect very much abstraction, and expect to get your hands
quite dirty, this is C after all. Here is some documentation to
give you a basic run down of what is happening:




GLOBAL VARIABLES:
	ships:				An array of all ships
	players:			An array of all players
	players.ships:		Array of IDs for ships owned by player
	players.dropoffs:	Array of IDs for dropoffs owned by player
	map:				An array of all map tiles'

	dropoffs:			An array of all dropoffs (x/y coordinates)
	mhh:				Map half height. Useful for determining distance
	mhw:				Map half width. Useful for determining distance
	my_id:				The ID in the players array for you
	map_size:			[0] is width, [1] is height
	number_of_players:	The... number of players?
	max_turn:			The last turn to give commands
	turn_number:		The current turn number

	log_file:			The file descriptor for the log file



FUNCTION REFERENCE:
	MACROS

	NORM_X:		Normalizes the X coordinate (0 - 1 = map_width, map_width + 1 = 0)
	NORM_Y:		Normalizes the Y coordinate (0 - 1 = map_height, map_height + 1 = 0)
	CALC_DIST:	Calculates the distance between two sets of X and Y values
	TILE_OCCUPIED:	1 if the tile has a ship on it, otherwise 0

	MOVE_STILL:	Move ship direction o, which keeps you ship on the same tile
	MOVE_NORTH: Move ship direction n, North
	MOVE_SOUTH: Move ship direction s, South
	MOVE_EAST: Move ship direction e, East
	MOVE_WEST: Move ship direction w, West
	CONVERT_DROPOFF:	Converts the ship into a dropoff
	SPAWN_SHIP:			Creates a ship in your ship yard


	NORMAL FUNCTIONS

	random_move:		Moves the ship in a random direction
	naive_natigate:		Same as random_move, but avoid collisions



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

Simply cd into the directory and type "make". If this doesn't work,
file a bug report and we can hopefully work together to make the
starter kit better. 



NOTES:

 * Your bot name and all turns must end with a \n new line character,
or else your bot will fail to initialize or move.
 * The default "smart" logic isn't very smart.
 * https://halite.io/learn-programming-challenge/api-docs for a
definitive reference on game rules.
