# Swift Starter Kit
This is the basic implementation in Swift! Most everything matches the python
implementation, but there are a few additional interfaces that match Swift
convention (`Player.ships` in addition to `Player.getShips()` for instance.)
Use whichever interface you'd like.

On OS X, you can open the Halite-III.xcodeproj file in Xcode. Running the app
on its own doesn't do anything, however.

## Things to note
* The script to edit is `main.swift` and not `MyBot.swift`.
* Run `./zip.sh` to compress just the bot code (not anything in the tests
  directory) into `MyBot.zip` to submit

Good luck!
